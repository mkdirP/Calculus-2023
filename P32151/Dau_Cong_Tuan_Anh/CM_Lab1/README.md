### Conclusion: 
<code>After this laboratory work, I have learnt many new: resolve system of equations by method Gauss, Gauss method with choice main element, iterative methods, method Gauss - Seidel. As far as I understand, the first two methods, we use linear algebra, while the latter two, we use the convergent method: i.e. converge to the approximate result, when the error is less than the given epsilon </code>
